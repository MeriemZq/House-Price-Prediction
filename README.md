# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. 
The project explores data preprocessing techniques and utilizes machine learning models to predict the target variable, `median_house_value`.

## Installation

This project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- `Project_1_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook with code for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Data Exploration**: Conduct an initial exploration to understand data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and performing any transformations (e.g., logarithmic scaling).
4. **Feature Engineering**: Select and transform relevant features.
5. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models, such as Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor, to predict house prices.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared to understand the accuracy of predictions.

## Results

The models' performance is evaluated based on their predictive accuracy, with results visualized through plots and reported metrics. Specific insights or limitations of the models used are discussed within the notebook.
